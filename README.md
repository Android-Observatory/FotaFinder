# FotaFinder
FotaFinder is a static analysis tool to detect if an Android app contains Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) or OTA capablities, i.e., the ability to install system updates (FOTA) or just regular apps (OTA). FotaFinder operates by statically identifying signals in the code that indicate installation capabilities.
